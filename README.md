# ðŸ§¤ Prompt-library-for-AI-for-WMS-visual-process-guide-using-ToT technique
This repository helps visualise the complete process flow of an Advanced Warehouse Management System (AWMS) using prompt engineering visualisations. The objective is to train models to think step-by-step and understand multi-stage industrial systems through Tree-of-Thought (ToT) technique

## ðŸŒ‚ Root Prompt (Step-By-Step decomposition)
"Visualize a smart warehouse where goods are scanned, sorted, stored in tall automated racks, retrieved by robotic arms, packed on conveyers, and dispatched via loading bays with barcode tracking systems. Bright lighting, organized layout, and real-time dashboards

## ðŸŒ² Tree-of-Thoughts - ToT prompts
Each ToT branch is a building block for the visual narrative:

### 1. Goods Inward Logistics
**Dall-E 2**: A modern warehouse receiving dock with trucks unloading barcoded pallets, staff scanning items with handheld scanners, clean industrial background, real-time inventory monitor on the wall

**Imagen**: Realistic warehouse receiving zone where trucks unload barcoded boxes. Workers scan items. Clean, well-lit, organized entry area

**Stable Diffusion**: Photorealistic warehouse dock, trucks backed into bays, workers using barcode scanners, stacks of labeled cartons on pallets, digital dashboard display in the background

**Midjourney**: Warehouse inbound receiving area, barcoded pallets being scanned, trucks unloading, staff in safety vests, industrial lighting, cinematic shot -v 5 -ar 16:9

### 2. Inventory storage automation
**Dall-E 2**: Automated warehouse with tall storage racks, robotic arms placing boxes, floor-marked AGV routes, blinking LED indicators

**Imagen**: High-tech warehouse interior, ASRS robots placing packages into high shelves. Brigh lighting. Autonomous robots moving between aisles

**Stable Diffusion**: AI-powered warehouse, robotic arms organizing boxes on vertical racks, floor paths glowing, automated guided vehicles navigating safely

**Midjourney**: Futuristic warehouse with automated storage racks, robots sorting boxes, organized shelves, glowing floor lines, high detail -v 5 -ar 3:2

### 3. Order picking & Fulfillment
**Dall-E 2**: Order fulfillment zone in a warehouse with smart glass-wearing workers picking items from shelves. Autonomous carts follow digital instructions on the floor

**Imagen**: E-commerce warehouse with voice-guided pickers, mobile carts carrying selected goods, smart order displays visible above shelves

**Stable diffusion**: Clean, modern warehouse picking area with employees using AR glasses, robots assisting in item retrieval, pick-to-light modules glowing on shelves

**Midjourney**: Warehouse pick zone with smart tech, AR glasses, robots and humans working together, modern logistics scene -v 5 -ar 16:9

### 4. Packing & Quality Check
**Dall-E 2**: Automated packaging station in a warehouse, boxes on conveyor belts, employees checking quality with tablets, label printers in the background

**Imagen**: Warehouse packaging zone with sealed boxes on conveyers, real-tiem QC monitors, staff using handheld tablets

**Stable Diffusion**: Smart warehouse packaging area, conveyors moving boxes, automated sealing machines, workers performing quality check with scanners

**Midjourney**: Warehouse packing line, quality control checks, label printers, real-time dashboard, busy fulfillment line -v 5 -ar 16:9

### 5. Dispatch & Shipping
**Dall-E 2**: Final shipping area of a warehouse, parcels arranged by delivery zones, trucks being loaded, large monitor showing GPS tracking 

**Imagen**: Warehouse outbound zone, sorted packages labeled by zip code, workers loading trucks, dispatch screen showing delivery routes

**Stable diffusion**: Organized dispatch station, parcels grouped by zone, loading dock in action, route planning software visible on monitor

**Midjourney**: Warehouse dispatch center, loaded trolleys, labeled boxes, trucks ready for shipping, digital map of delivery routes -v 5 -ar 3:2
